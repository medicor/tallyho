# Tallyho - ExtJS version
This is a version of TallyHo, made with ExtJS 3.2 and an WCF OData service backend.
TallyHo was a simple time-tracking and invoicing application, suitable for small companies like my [own](http://www.medicor.se/).
In 2009, [Sencha's ExtJS](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/#overview) was the application framework of choice for many developers. The idea of what was "state of the art" 
was during subsequent years replaced with Backbone, Ember, AngularJS and React.

There is a [live demo](https://medicor.github.io/tallyho/default.htm) :smirk:.
